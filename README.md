### `ProductsTable.js`
- **Product Management**: Manages a list of products that includes product name, quantity, and price.
- **Total Calculations**: Automatically calculates totals based on product price and quantity.
  
### `Price.js`

- **Dynamic Calculations**: Updates as the user adds or removes products.

### `Header.js`
- **Branding & Logo**: Displays the app’s logo (imported from `logo-main.png`) and the title in the invoice.
